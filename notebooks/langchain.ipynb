A search on arXiv returned one paper titled “Rebuttal of Morris' criticism of the diffusive compressible Euler model” (pdf link: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.18241v1). I will now summarize the content of this paper to see if it relates to diffusion models in the context expected for 2024, and then provide an answer based on that summary.  \n",

The dcE model modifies the standard Euler equations by adding diffusion terms—characterized by a coefficient ν and an extra heat diffusion term κT—to represent random molecular transport rather than traditional viscosity. Svärd clarifies that these parameters must be empirically tuned and distinguishes between diffusion and heat conduction. He argues that while the dcE model is sometimes labeled “viscous and heat conductive” to align with the Navier-Stokes-Fourier (NSF) equations for ideal gases, it does not truly model viscosity; rather, it offers a new paradigm that performs comparably to NSF for ideal gases under normal conditions, even in shock scenarios.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, Svärd addresses Morris’s objections regarding sound attenuation and heat flux predictions. He notes that criticisms based on outdated models or misapplications (e.g., to liquids) are unfounded since the dcE model was designed specifically for gases. The discussion further touches on the challenges of choosing an appropriate bulk viscosity in gas models, with both dcE and NSF models showing strengths and weaknesses under different conditions. Svärd also defends the dcE model’s adherence to material frame indifference by emphasizing its basis in conservation laws and Fourier-type diffusion, rather than relying solely on viscous stress formulations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the note argues that the dcE model, while still under development and not intended for liquids or strongly non-ideal gases, offers advantages in mathematical well-posedness and computational efficiency compared to the long-established but more complex NSF system.\u001b[0m\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3mQuestion: diffusion models 2024  \n",
      "Thought: The query “diffusion models 2024” appears to refer to recent developments related to diffusion models, particularly in connection with modifications to fluid dynamic equations that include diffusive terms, such as the diffusive compressible Euler (dcE) model. I began by searching arXiv using “diffusion models 2024” and found one relevant paper: “Rebuttal of Morris' criticism of the diffusive compressible Euler model” (PDF link: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.18241v1). This paper, authored by Magnus Svärd, discusses the dcE model—a variant of the Euler equations where diffusion terms (representing random molecular transport) are introduced.\n",

      "The summary of the paper indicates that the dcE model includes a diffusion coefficient (ν) and an extra heat diffusion term (κT). Unlike traditional viscosity-based models, such as the Navier-Stokes-Fourier (NSF) system, the dcE model is designed for ideal gasses and offers an alternative paradigm. Svärd defends the model against criticisms by emphasizing that its diffusion parameters must be empirically tuned and are fundamentally different from viscosity. He highlights that while the dcE model resembles established models under normal conditions (including shock scenarios), it represents a new perspective on modeling transport phenomena. The discussion also covers issues like sound attenuation, heat flux predictions, choices for bulk viscosity, and compliance with material frame indifference, all of which are key points in the ongoing debate about model suitability and computational efficiency in fluid dynamics.\n",

      "Final Answer: In the context of 2024 research on diffusion models, one notable development is the continued refinement and defense of the diffusive compressible Euler (dcE) model. This model modifies the traditional Euler equations by incorporating diffusion terms to simulate random molecular transport in ideal gases. Rather than modeling viscous stresses in the usual way, it introduces a diffusion coefficient and a heat diffusion term, offering an alternative framework that can perform similarly to the Navier-Stokes-Fourier system under certain conditions. Recent discussions, such as the one presented in Magnus Svärd’s paper, focus on empirically tuning these diffusion parameters, addressing criticisms (e.g., regarding sound attenuation and heat flux predictions), and demonstrating advantages in mathematical well-posedness and computational efficiency.

      "Magnus Svärd’s note defends the diffusive compressible Euler (dcE) model against M. Morris’s criticisms regarding its prediction of heat diffusion and sound attenuation. The dcE model modifies the classical Euler equations by adding diffusion terms—including a recently reinstated heat term (κT)—based on constitutive laws that require experimental calibration, rather than fundamental constants. Although the model uses language similar to that of the Navier–Stokes–Fourier (NSF) system, it does not actually incorporate viscosity and is tailored for nearly ideal gases, not liquids. Svärd contends that Morris’s critiques rely on outdated model versions (lacking the κT term) and misinterpret the role of bulk viscosity, especially since proper selection of this parameter is vital for capturing non-ideal energy exchanges in polyatomic gases. The note argues that while both dcE and NSF have limitations, the dcE model offers advantages such as weak well-posedness for more efficient numerical solutions, and that criticisms on frame dependency and high-frequency inaccuracies are either misunderstandings or issues common to similar models.\u001b[0m\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3mQuestion: find Rebuttal of Morris' criticism of the diffusive compressible Euler model paper and give its summary\n",

Morris. The note explains that the dcE model—unlike the classical Euler equations—is modified to include diffusion terms (notably, a recently reinstated heat diffusion term, κT) based on experimentally calibrated constitutive laws rather than on fundamental constants. Svärd argues that Morris’s critique is based on an outdated version of the model (lacking the κT term) and that his interpretation of bulk viscosity’s role is misguided. In the dcE formulation, proper treatment of viscosity-related parameters is essential for adequately capturing non-ideal energy exchanges in polyatomic gases. Moreover, while both the dcE and traditional Navier–Stokes–Fourier models have limitations, Svärd contends that the dcE model provides advantages such as weak well-posedness and improved numerical efficiency. Overall, the paper posits that criticisms around frame dependency and high-frequency behavior either stem from common issues in similar approximations or are misinterpretations of the model's underlying physics.\u001b[0m\n",
